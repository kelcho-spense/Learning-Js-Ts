## Audience
This Tutorial is intended to help a newbie or beginner programmer get started with JavaScript.

## Introduction

It is one of the most famous & commonly used languages. Today Javascript powers millions of web pages and makes them interactive. It helps validate forms, run business logic on the client, create cookies, animate, and more. It runs on all devices, including Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS, etc., and is supported by all browsers.

### What is Javascript

Javascript is the _scripting language_, we use to make web pages interactive. It is written in plain text on the HTML page and runs in the browser. Modern JavaScript evolved so much that, it can run on the server side today. We use it along with HTML & CSS and powers the entire web.

### History

* **Brendan Eich** of `Netscape` developed JavaScript for Netscape in `1995`. It started as **`Mocha`**, then became **`LiveScript`**, and later **`JavaScript`**.
* Java was a very popular language at that time. Hence the marketing folks at Netscape decided to name it JavaScript to encash Java’s popularity. They also designed it so that its syntax looks similar to that of Java.
* Microsoft included support for JavaScript (named JScript) from Internet Explorer 3.0. It also had its scripting language VBScript. Other browsers also incorporated JavaScript, while VBScript remained only with Internet Explorer. This eventually led to the demise of VBScript.
* The browser vendors started to come out with their implementation of JavaScript. Since there was no standard, each browser was free to implement. Hence the need for standardizing the syntax & rules of JavaScript.
* In 1997. Netscape presented JavaScript to [ECMA International](https://ecma-international.org/), which standardized the specifications of the JavaScript under the name ECMAScript specifications (pronounced as “ek-ma-script”). The browsers now implement Javascript using **ECMAScript specifications**, which is why the JavaScript programs behave similarly across all browsers.

### JavaScript is an interpreted language
* JavaScript is an **`interpreted language`**. We **cannot compile a JavaScript program into an executable**. We distribute it as plain text.
* To run an interpreted language, the client machines require an Interpreter. `The Interpreters read the program line by line and execute each command`. The `Interpreted languages` were once significantly slower than compiled languages.
* Every browser comes with a built-in Interpreter in the form of a **`Javascript virtual machine`**

### Javascript virtual machine
The JavaScript virtual machine (JVM) is the component of the browser that reads our JavaScript code, optimizes, and executes it.

The job of JVM is to Interpret the JavaScript code and run it. Each browser comes with a version of JVM. The following are some of the popular JVM: 

* [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) — Developed by Google for chrome.
* [Rhino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_(JavaScript_engine)) — Developed by Mozilla Foundation for Firefox
* [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey_(JavaScript_engine)) — The first JavaScript engine, used by Netscape Navigator, and today powers Firefox
* [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) — Developed by Apple for Safari
* [Chakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra_(JavaScript_engine)) — Developed by Microsoft and runs on Microsoft Edge
* [JerryScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JerryScript) — is a lightweight engine for the IoT devices

### Javascript Tools & Frameworks
Many tools, Libraries & Frameworks are available, making working with Javascript easier.

A [JavaScript framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_framework) is an application framework written in JavaScript. It contains tools & libraries and defines the entire application design.

The following are some of the popular JavaScript libraries & frameworks :
1. Angular
2. React
3. jQuery
4. Vue.js
5. Ext.js
6. Ember.js
7. Meteor
8. Mithril
9. Node.js
10. Aurelia
11. Backbone.js

### Javascript Transpilers
A JavaScript Transpiler is a tool that reads source code written in a different programming language and produces an equivalent code in Javascript.
1. Typescript
2. Dart
3. Babel
4. CoffeeScript
5. Coco
6. LiveScript
7. UberScript
