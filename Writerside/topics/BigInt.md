# BigInt

### BigInt Data Type in TypeScript

The **`BigInt`** data type was introduced to JavaScript and TypeScript to allow representation of **arbitrary-precision integers**. While the regular `number` type in JavaScript/TypeScript can represent integers up to **2^53 - 1** (`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), `BigInt` can handle integers much larger than this, or even smaller than `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`.

### Key Characteristics of BigInt:

* **Arbitrary-Precision**: Unlike the `number` type which is limited to **double-precision floating point format**, `BigInt` can handle integers of arbitrary size, which means you can work with very large or very small integers beyond the safe limits of `number`.
* **Syntax**: A `BigInt` is created by appending an `n` to the end of an integer literal. For example, `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n`.

### 1. **Creating BigInt**

You can create a `BigInt` in two ways:

1. **Using the `n` suffix** (recommended):

   ```typescript
   let bigNum: BigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
   console.log(bigNum);  // Output: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
   ```

2. **Using the `BigInt()` constructor**:

   ```typescript
   let bigNum: BigInt = BigInt("1234567890123456789012345678901234567890");
   console.log(bigNum);  // Output: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
   ```

    * The `BigInt()` constructor accepts a string that represents the integer.
    * You cannot directly pass a floating-point number or a non-numeric string.

### 2. **Operations with BigInt**

You can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation with `BigInt`.

#### Example:

```typescript
let num1: BigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
let num2: BigInt = 9876543210987654321098765432109876543210n;

let sum: BigInt = num1 + num2;
let difference: BigInt = num2 - num1;
let product: BigInt = num1 * num2;
let quotient: BigInt = num2 / num1;

console.log(sum);        // Output: 11111111101111111110111111111011111111100n
console.log(difference); // Output: 8641975320864197532086429753208641975320n
console.log(product);    // Output: 121932631137021795226186647069939035392315418531801907245933536542406477279031453736177535709258073310000n
console.log(quotient);   // Output: 8n
```

**Note**: Operations with `BigInt` return values of type `BigInt`.

---

### 3. **BigInt and Comparison**

You can compare `BigInt` values using comparison operators such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `===`, and `!==`.

#### Example:

```typescript
let num1: BigInt = 1000n;
let num2: BigInt = 500n;

console.log(num1 > num2);   // Output: true
console.log(num1 === num2); // Output: false
```

### 4. **BigInt and Type Safety**

`BigInt` is not directly compatible with the `number` type, meaning that you cannot mix `BigInt` and `number` values in arithmetic operations.

For example:

```typescript
let num: number = 10;
let bigNum: BigInt = 1000n;

console.log(num + bigNum); // Error: Cannot mix BigInt and other types
```

To resolve this, you would need to explicitly convert one type to the other, which is not always recommended unless you are sure about your logic.

### BigInt vs. Number

Although `BigInt` offers significant advantages in terms of handling large integers, there are key differences between `BigInt` and `number`:

| **Feature**       | **BigInt**                                                               | **Number**                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Size**          | Can represent arbitrarily large integers.                                | Limited to **2^53 - 1** for integers.                                        |
| **Type**          | Used specifically for large integers.                                    | Can represent both integers and floating-point numbers.                      |
| **Precision**     | Supports exact precision for large integers.                             | Limited precision due to floating-point representation (IEEE 754).           |
| **Operations**    | Supports arithmetic operations but only with other `BigInt`s.            | Supports both integers and floating-point numbers, and operations with both. |
| **Syntax**        | Created with `n` suffix or `BigInt()` constructor.                       | Normal numbers written directly (e.g., `123.45`, `100`).                     |
| **Compatibility** | Cannot be mixed with `number` in operations without explicit conversion. | Can easily be mixed with other `number` types in arithmetic.                 |
| **Use Case**      | Use when working with large integers or arbitrary precision.             | Use for typical numbers (integers and floating-point).                       |

#### Example: BigInt vs. Number

```typescript
let bigIntVal: BigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
let numberVal: number = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;

console.log(typeof bigIntVal);  // Output: bigint
console.log(typeof numberVal);  // Output: number

// BigInt and number cannot be mixed directly:
console.log(bigIntVal + numberVal); // Error: Cannot mix BigInt and other types.
```

To work with a `BigInt` and `number` together, you can convert one to the other explicitly, but it's generally not recommended because it might cause precision issues or other errors.

### 5. **When to Use BigInt**

* **Large Numbers**: Use `BigInt` when you need to work with numbers beyond the limit of `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (i.e., larger than **2^53 - 1**).
* **Cryptography**: For cryptographic algorithms or applications involving very large prime numbers, `BigInt` is a suitable choice.
* **High Precision Calculations**: If your application requires high precision for very large integers, `BigInt` is ideal.

### 6. **Limitations of BigInt**

* **Performance**: `BigInt` operations might be slower than `number` operations, especially for smaller values.
* **No Floating-Point Support**: `BigInt` cannot be used with floating-point numbers. If you need to work with both integers and floating-point values, you will need to use `number` for floating-point operations.
* **No Implicit Type Conversion**: TypeScript will not automatically convert between `BigInt` and `number`, which means you'll need to handle the type conversion manually.

### Summary of Key Differences Between `BigInt` and `Number`

| **Aspect**                | **BigInt**                           | **Number**                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Size Limit**            | Arbitrary precision                  | Limited to 2^53 - 1 for integers                            |
| **Floating Point**        | No floating-point support            | Supports both integers and floating-point numbers           |
| **Use Case**              | Large integers, exact precision      | General-purpose numbers                                     |
| **Syntax**                | `123456789n`, `BigInt()` constructor | `123`, `123.45`                                             |
| **Arithmetic with Types** | Only with other `BigInt` types       | Can work with both `number` and `BigInt` (after conversion) |
| **Mixing Types**          | Cannot mix with `number`             | Can mix with `number` in operations                         |

In conclusion, **`BigInt`** is an excellent choice for working with large integers or when exact precision is required. However, if you donâ€™t need to work with very large numbers and need to handle both integers and floating-point numbers, **`number`** might be more efficient and flexible.
