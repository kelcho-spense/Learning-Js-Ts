# Prototypes &amp; Inheritance

### Prototypes and Inheritance in JavaScript

JavaScript is an object-oriented language, but it uses a unique inheritance model called **prototype-based inheritance**. Unlike class-based inheritance in languages like Java or C++, JavaScript uses prototypes to allow objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

Let’s dive deep into **prototypes** and **inheritance** in JavaScript with detailed explanations and examples.

---

### 1. **Prototypes in JavaScript**

Every JavaScript object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, which is a reference to another object. This object is called the **prototype**. Prototypes allow objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

In simpler terms:

* **Prototype** is like a blueprint for an object. Objects can inherit methods and properties from their prototype object.

#### Example: Using Prototypes

```javascript
// Create an object with some properties
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
    }
};

// Create another object using `Object.create()`, inheriting from `person`
let anotherPerson = Object.create(person);
anotherPerson.firstName = "Jane";
anotherPerson.lastName = "Smith";

anotherPerson.greet(); // Outputs: "Hello, Jane Smith"
```

### Explanation:

* `person` is an object with properties `firstName`, `lastName`, and a method `greet()`.
* `anotherPerson` is created with `Object.create(person)`, which means `anotherPerson` will inherit properties and methods from `person`. The `greet()` method of `person` is available to `anotherPerson`, so when we call `anotherPerson.greet()`, it successfully accesses the inherited method.

The prototype of `anotherPerson` is `person`, so when `anotherPerson` doesn't have its own `greet()` method, it looks up to its prototype (`person`) to find it.

---

### 2. **Prototype Chain**

The **prototype chain** is a chain of objects connected through the `[[Prototype]]` property. If an object does not have a property or method, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype. If it's not found in the prototype, the search continues up the prototype chain.

The prototype chain looks like this:

* When you access a property or method of an object, JavaScript first checks the object itself.
* If the property or method isn’t found in the object, it checks the prototype (the object from which the current object was created).
* If it's still not found, it checks the prototype of the prototype, and so on until it reaches `null`, which is the end of the prototype chain.

#### Example: Prototype Chain

```javascript
let animal = {
    eats: true
};

let dog = Object.create(animal); // dog inherits from animal
dog.barks = true;

let puppy = Object.create(dog); // puppy inherits from dog

console.log(puppy.eats);  // Inherited from animal - true
console.log(puppy.barks); // Inherited from dog - true
console.log(puppy.hasOwnProperty('eats')); // false, puppy doesn't have 'eats' directly
console.log(puppy.hasOwnProperty('barks')); // false, puppy doesn't have 'barks' directly
```

### Explanation:

* `animal` has a property `eats`.
* `dog` inherits from `animal` and has an additional property `barks`.
* `puppy` inherits from `dog` (and therefore from `animal` too).

When you access `puppy.eats`, JavaScript checks if `puppy` has the `eats` property. It doesn't, so it looks up the prototype chain and finds it in `animal`.

The **prototype chain** works recursively, so the `puppy` object has access to properties of both `dog` and `animal`.

---

### 3. **Constructor Functions and Prototypes**

In JavaScript, you can create multiple instances of objects using **constructor functions**. These functions are used to create objects, and each object created by the constructor function has access to the methods defined on the constructor’s prototype.

#### Example: Constructor Function and Prototypes

```javascript
// Constructor function
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

// Add method to the prototype
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
};

// Create an instance
let john = new Person("John", "Doe");
john.greet();  // Outputs: "Hello, John Doe"
```

### Explanation:

* `Person` is a **constructor function**. When you call `new Person()`, a new object is created, and `this` inside the constructor refers to that object.
* The `greet()` method is added to `Person.prototype`. This means that all instances of `Person` (like `john`) will have access to the `greet()` method via the prototype.

You can add methods to an object’s prototype to ensure they are shared among all instances of that object, rather than each instance having its own copy of the method.

---

### 4. **Inheritance in JavaScript**

**Inheritance** in JavaScript refers to an object gaining access to properties and methods of another object. With prototype-based inheritance, JavaScript allows one object to inherit from another by linking their prototypes.

#### Example: Inheritance Using Constructor Functions

```javascript
// Parent constructor function
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

// Parent method
Animal.prototype.makeSound = function() {
    console.log(this.name + " makes a sound");
};

// Child constructor function
function Dog(name, breed) {
    Animal.call(this, name);  // Call parent constructor with `this` binding
    this.breed = breed;
}

// Inherit from Animal
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

// Child method
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    console.log(this.name + " barks");
};

// Create instances
let myDog = new Dog("Max", "Golden Retriever");

myDog.makeSound();  // Inherited from Animal - "Max makes a sound"
myDog.bark();       // Defined in Dog - "Max barks"
```

### Explanation:

* **Inheritance in JavaScript** can be achieved by setting the prototype of the child constructor (`Dog`) to be an instance of the parent constructor’s prototype (`Animal.prototype`).
* `Animal.call(this, name)` ensures that the `name` property is inherited from the `Animal` constructor function.
* `Dog.prototype` is now linked to `Animal.prototype`, so instances of `Dog` have access to methods defined in `Animal`.

### 5. **ES6 Classes and Inheritance**

With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript introduced **classes** to provide a more familiar syntax for object creation and inheritance (similar to class-based inheritance in other languages like Java or Python). However, under the hood, JavaScript classes are still using prototype-based inheritance.

#### Example: ES6 Classes and Inheritance

```javascript
// Parent class
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    makeSound() {
        console.log(this.name + " makes a sound");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name);  // Call the parent constructor
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    bark() {
        console.log(this.name + " barks");
    }
}

// Create an instance
let myDog = new Dog("Max", "Golden Retriever");

myDog.makeSound();  // Inherited from Animal - "Max makes a sound"
myDog.bark();       // Defined in Dog - "Max barks"
```

### Explanation:

* **ES6 `class` syntax** makes the code cleaner and more readable. The `extends` keyword is used to set up inheritance.
* `super(name)` calls the constructor of the parent class (`Animal`), and the child class (`Dog`) adds its own properties and methods.
* The prototype-based inheritance still applies under the hood, but the class syntax provides a more traditional object-oriented approach.
