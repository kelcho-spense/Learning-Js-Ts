# OOP Practise Scenarios

Great â€” let's elevate the **complexity** of each OOP scenario. Below are **enhanced versions** of the same ideas, introducing deeper interactions, more OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction), and even some design patterns where applicable.

### ðŸ”· 1. **Advanced Library Management System**

**Description:**
Design a system for managing a full-service library, including book lending, user accounts, overdue fines, and digital resources.

#### Key Elements:

* **`LibraryItem` (abstract)** â†’ base for `Book`, `DVD`, `EBook`
* **`UserAccount`** â†’ handles login, borrowing history, fine calculation
* **`Borrowable` Interface** â†’ enforces `checkOut()` and `returnItem()` for physical items only
* **`Librarian` vs `Member` (inherit from `User`)**
* **Feature:** Fine is auto-calculated based on return date

> ðŸ”¹ *Polymorphism* through multiple item types
> ðŸ”¹ *Encapsulation* of fine logic in `UserAccount`
> ðŸ”¹ *Abstraction* using an abstract `LibraryItem`
> ðŸ”¹ *Interface* for borrowable vs digital-only items

### ðŸ”· 2. **Advanced E-Commerce System**

**Description:**
Create a multi-vendor e-commerce platform supporting different product types, user roles (admin, customer, seller), discounts, and order tracking.

#### Key Elements:

* **`Product` (abstract)** â†’ extended by `ElectronicProduct`, `ClothingProduct`, `FurnitureProduct`
* **`User`** â†’ extended by `Admin`, `Seller`, `Customer`
* **`Cart`** â†’ holds products, calculates total with tax and discount
* **`Order`** â†’ links to `Shipping`, `Payment`, and `Customer`
* **Strategy Pattern:** Discount strategy applied at checkout

> ðŸ”¹ *Inheritance* for product and user types
> ðŸ”¹ *Polymorphism* for payment (e.g. card, wallet, COD)
> ðŸ”¹ *Encapsulation* of cart/checkout logic
> ðŸ”¹ *Design Patterns:* Strategy (for discount), Factory (for product creation)

### ðŸ”· 3. **University Registration & Learning Management System**

**Description:**
Build a system that manages course registration, class schedules, grading, and content distribution. Include roles for students, professors, and administrators.

#### Key Elements:

* **`Person`** â†’ base for `Student`, `Professor`, `Admin`
* **`Course`** â†’ includes lectures, assignments, enrolled students
* **`Enrollment` Class** â†’ maps students to courses with grading logic
* **`Assessment` Interface** â†’ implemented by `Quiz`, `Assignment`, `Project`
* **Notification System** for reminders and feedback

> ðŸ”¹ *Abstraction* for people and content
> ðŸ”¹ *Polymorphism* in assessments
> ðŸ”¹ *Encapsulation* of grade calculations
> ðŸ”¹ *Composite Pattern* for course content (modules contain lectures, assignments)

### ðŸ”· 4. **Ride Sharing System with Dynamic Pricing & Ratings**

**Description:**
Create a full ride-sharing platform with user authentication, GPS location tracking, ride history, and driver/passenger matching logic.

#### Key Elements:

* **`User`** â†’ parent for `Driver`, `Passenger`
* **`Ride`** â†’ includes pickup/dropoff, fare calculation, ratings
* **Dynamic Pricing Strategy** based on time of day, traffic
* **Vehicle Management** for drivers
* **Matching Algorithm** â†’ nearest driver selection

> ðŸ”¹ *Polymorphism* in pricing strategies
> ðŸ”¹ *Encapsulation* of rating and fare logic
> ðŸ”¹ *Strategy Pattern* for fare calculation
> ðŸ”¹ *Factory Pattern* for creating ride instances

### ðŸ”· 5. **Intelligent Zoo Management System**

**Description:**
Develop a smart zoo system with intelligent feeding schedules, sensor-driven habitat monitoring, and animal behavior tracking.

#### Key Elements:

* **`Animal` (abstract)** â†’ extended by `Bird`, `Mammal`, `Reptile`
* **`Habitat`** â†’ includes temperature, feeding schedule, cleanliness
* **Observer Pattern:** Animal health alerts via sensors
* **`FeedingStrategy` Interface** â†’ different feeding logic for herbivores, carnivores, omnivores
* **Zookeeper & Vet Roles** for monitoring

> ðŸ”¹ *Polymorphism* in animal behavior and feeding
> ðŸ”¹ *Encapsulation* of habitat control
> ðŸ”¹ *Observer Pattern* for real-time alerts
> ðŸ”¹ *Interface Segregation* for specific animal actions (fly, swim, hibernate)
